## Description

Currently, League of Legends is one of the most popular computer games in the world, and thanks to that it has a large number of viewers during various tournaments. For them, we want to create a database in which anyone will be able to find all the information about teams, games, etc. The database should help not only spectators who are interested in this game, but also people who make bets on sports.

## Must-have entities and attributes

* All leagues (tournaments) that take place regularly, their name, dates and prize pool.
* All teams participating in the leagues, their names. Each team should have a player and a coach (at least one).
* Information about employees who work for individual leagues (commentators, analysts, etc.), their age, name and surname.
* Places where leagues are held, either studios or stadiums, their name, cities and country where they are located.
* All information about players (their name and surname, nickname, age, place of birth and role in teams).
* A list of coaches from which we should know their name, surname, place of birth and age.
* Information about sponsors, their name (or organization name). The sponsor can support either a team or a tournament (league).
